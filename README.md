## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- Started to use some Semantic HTML in the code to break it down better for accessibility.
- Using more CSS Variables to make things more reusable

### Continued development

- Need to remember to normalise the CSS before starting - always forget this
- Need to understand is it better to call the font directly into the CSS or via HTML header as I have been doing so
- Need to start using REM / EM sizing rather than direct pixels
